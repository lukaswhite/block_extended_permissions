block_extended_permissions module
---------------------------------

This very simple module extends Drupal 7's block permissions to make them more granular.

Example scenario; you  may wish to create blocks and allow site users to modify their content,
but not move them. In this case you would grant the appropriate role the permissions "edit block titles"
and "edit block description" but not "edit block description", "edit block regions" or "edit block visibility"

Note that people with the "administer blocks" permission will get an empty form if they aren't assigned at least
one permission, so please use common sense.
